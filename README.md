Tartan Testing Website

1. Home page: index.html

2. Product browsing page: loggedin-home.html
Since there are no specific products being sold, I made the page after logging in
the product browsing page as that is where users can see what they can do within
the website.

3. Product detail page: appt-type.html; appt-time.html
Since there are no products, I made the "Schedule a COVID-19 Test" the "product" and
created the pages where a user would schedule a test as the product detail pages.
